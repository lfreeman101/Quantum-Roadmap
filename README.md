# ⚛️ Quantum Mechanics Training Plan – 3 Month Roadmap

Welcome to your **digital quantum dojo**. This repo is both a **progress tracker** and a **sandbox** for Python simulations, notes, and problem sets.  
By the end of Month 3, you’ll go from Schrödinger’s confused housecat → to a wavefunction-slinging undergrad → to someone who can argue Bell’s theorem at 3 AM.
